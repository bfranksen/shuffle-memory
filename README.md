# Shuffle Memory

Hosted at:

Shuffle Memory is a twist on the classic Memory game. Any time you are unable to make a match, the board shifts in a random direction.

**Purpose**
  - This project is my first attempt at creating a website using Node, Pug, and other web dev tools. 
  - Not a fully responsive design as of yet, especially on mobile.
  - I am exploring web development and will continue to update this project as I learn and gain skills.
